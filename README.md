# Path Prediction using KNN and Decision Tree

This project implements path prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset contains x and y coordinates representing paths. The data is divided into training and testing sets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/path-prediction.git
cd path-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python path_prediction.py
