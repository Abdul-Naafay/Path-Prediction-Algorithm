# Path Prediction using KNN and Decision Tree

This group project implements path prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset contains x and y coordinates representing paths. The data is divided into training and testing sets.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/path-prediction.git
    cd path-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python path_prediction.py
